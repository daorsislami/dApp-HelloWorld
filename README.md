# ðŸ—ƒ Hello World Smart Contract with React 

This project is a simple Hello World smart contract an introduction for me starting the web3.0 journey, here we 
use to write to the smart contract deployed to Holesky testnet, read & write data to blockchain and also interact with the smart contract via React frontend. Here I integrated other web3 tools in order to interact with the smart contract using Metamask and Web3 tools.


# If you cannot get it to run please install this package: npm install -g npm-check-updates
This is a dependency where it automatically checks for your outdated dependencies and lists them, then to update all of them 
automatically you can just run `ncu` and it will go ahead do it's job

After it updates the dependencies you can run `npm install` 


# To start the applicaton 
`npm start`


# More info about the dApp
This dApp interacts with a Hello World smart contract which you can see it here, it is already verified and you can see the smart contract code, for testnet I've used Holesky since I had some troubles with Sepolia testnet.
